            <h4>Week One</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>This first week of the course has mainly been focused on introductions, both of the structure of our assignments and of the teachers themselves. As such it doesn’t give much to write about.
                This course will be an interesting experience for me. Although not the first interaction design paper I’ve taken, my major lies in Communication Design as well as English in my BA, so it has been some time since I’ve had to flex my web design muscles and I’m interested to see how much I’ve retained. 
                Back in the yesteryear of highschool I was asked to create a website for IT class and it became my lockdown magnum opus. So many late nights were put into that project simply for the joy of creating and watching my creation function, yet now all that knowledge has faded from my mind. I don’t think I’ve even got the file anymore. I’m hopeful that this course will provide an opportunity to recover those skills and learn some more along the way.

            <h4>Week Two</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>For week two I was once again not able to attend class but I read through the slides and watched the lectures so I don’t feel like I missed too much. I’m hoping that this unfortunate combination of distance learning and clashes won’t cause too much of a loss of learning. Only time will tell.
                This week has been about outlining the assignments of the course and introducing some core concepts of UX research and web coding. The UX elements are all things I’m familiar with from previous assignments though it was good to get a refresher. I found the part of the lecture outlining the early years of web design very interesting as it is something I am not that knowledgeable about (having not been alive) but which I’d like to know more about. The internet has become so bloated and corporation controlled in recent years that there is something almost idyllic about the early, ‘wild west web’ years when people were making things up as they went along. Regardless of personal interest, it is important to know the past when designing for the future so I found the lesson useful as well.
                As for the extra lecture on HTML basics, it is annoying to me how much I have forgotten about how the language works. I think these tutorial lectures are going to become very useful to have once we begin making our websites.

            <h4>Week Three</h
                <hr>4>
            <p>This week’s class was focused around design goals and the early preparation for project one. Understanding the user and their needs is the most vital aspect of UX and web design, so any learning on the subject is useful. However, most of what was taught in the lecture I was already familiar with from previous learning, so there was not that much of note. I did enjoy creating the venn diagram however, as it gave me a chance to think about what kind of website I wanted to create. 
                Although the lectures seem to be encouraging us to design an online shop or marketplace, I have decided I want to do something more unique that draws on my own interests. As such I want to make a website that teaches new tabletop players helpful information for getting into the hobby. When I first started playing tabletop games, this was the kind of website that I would have found useful, so I believe providing that for other players may be of worth. I have therefore started to think about what kind of users would be approaching my website and what kinds of expectations and requirements they would have.
                Also this week was another coding lecture, this one exploring adding images and lists to a site. Since last week’s lecture I have installed VS Code on my computer and have begun playing around with it in my off time.

            <h4>Week Four</h4
                <hr>>
            <p>This week’s lecture essentially covered all that we needed to do for assignment one, going over user flows, personas and journey maps. I have already begun to think about each of these attributes, however I have not started anything as other classes and assignments have gotten in the way. The lecture also explored the later years of the internet leading up to the present, the so-called “web 2.0”, which has been more heavily focused around corporate control and social media. This look back at the development of the web over the last few classes has only emphasised to me how much I hate the current iteration of the internet, with its prioritisation of commercial greed over personal concerns. Truly, the internet has become a monster of our own Frankensteinian creation, and much like the creature of Shelley’s novel, it's definitely killed a few kids. 
                The coding lecture for this week covered some of the CSS side of web coding, showing how to set up styles for elements and the box model of padding, borders and margin. As interested as I am in doing the coding side of the course, I am not sure if I will end up coding the website for project 2.2. Although it might be fun, the pressure from other assignments due around the same time may mean I won’t have the time to do it and will have to use a CMS.

            <h4>Week Five</h4
                <hr>>
            <p>There was no main lecture recording posted this week, so instead I worked on my assignment; I decided to complete most of it this week as it would mean it was out of the way and I would have more time to work on assignments for other classes and think about project two. Overall I found the assignment a rewarding experience. I did find certain things difficult, such as having to create a user flow without having fully decided what was in my website yet as this felt a little backwards. However, I was proud of the fact that I took the time to do some actual (if a little limited) user testing on some of my friends and family members. This I think added to my understanding of what a potential user would be expecting from a website such as mine. 
                Instead of the main lecture recording there were two coding lectures, one on CSS grids and the other on flexboxes. Both were useful to my learning and what I learned could definitely be applied to my website if I decide to code it.

            <h4>Week Six</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>This week I handed in assignment one, which I felt was mostly a success. Had I done it again I would have perhaps gone into more detail about the user journey and given a more in depth flow chart, however time is always limited and I had to move on to other assignments. This week’s lecture jumped immediately into the steps for project 2.1. Luckily, I have done wireframes before for other classes and am familiar with using Figma, though the refresher was useful. After that was a discussion about colour theory in design and typography. The colour stuff I was well familiar with, however I didn’t know a lot of the rules around typography, such as leading and the rule for getting the right paragraph width. Although I was aware there were certain rules for type and colour in order to be readable, I did not know that there was a full guideline on accessible design, something that I will implement into my work for project two. 
                The coding lecture this week was about Github, something I had only briefly used in the past. I’m not entirely sure how useful it will be for the projects in this assignment, however it is nice to know about.

            <h4>Mid-Tri Break
                <hr>
            </h4>
            <p>I spent a lot of the mid-trimester break working (it was Burger Wellington and we were busy) so I didn’t have a lot of time to spend on assignments. What time I did have was unfortunately mostly eaten up by an English essay due in the first week of the break. The second week however I did spend some time creating some quick sketch wireframes for my website design as well as getting refamiliarised with Figma.

            <h4>Week Seven</h
                <hr>4>
            <p>I fell a bit behind this week due to pressures both from other classes and outside of uni (so behind that I am writing this in Week Eight instead). This meant that although I did watch the lecture, I was not able to fully digest it before handing in project 2.1. This is a shame as a lot of what was being taught may have been of use. I especially found the bits about page layouts and grids interesting to consider; hopefully I will be able to apply this learning to project 2.2 instead. It has become fairly clear to me that although I might have enjoyed coding it, project 2.2 will have to be made with a CMS in order to finish it on time and to a good degree of quality. This is a pity, but at least I will be able to do project 3 through coding instead. </p>

            <h4>Week Eight</h
                <hr>4>
            <p>Project 2.1 has been handed in. It was something of a rush to hand it in, but I only have my own bad time management to blame. Regardless, I felt that I did decent work on it. Had I had more time I would have loved to have done designs for the other pages of the website as I had some good ideas for them. There were several other visual elements that I would have liked to include, but perhaps I will have the chance with project 2.2. 
                The lecture this week was mainly focused on introducing project 2.2 and its two variations. As I have decided to work on a CMS, I was mainly focused on that side of the lecture. I have decided to use Editor X as generally it is considered newer and more usable than Webflow. Next week I will begin to look at how to use the app so that I am ready to work on project 2.2. 
                The coding lecture for this week was continuing on the subject of CSS grids. I found this lecture quite hard to follow as it was dealing with more complex stuff than previous weeks. Rather than relearning things, as I had been up until now, this was entirely new content for me. It was quite interesting despite this and taught me a lot about responsive design. If, in the future I have to make a fully responsive website I will refer back to my notes from this class.

            <h4>Week Nine</h4
                <hr>>
            <p>As we had just handed in the assignment last week, this week I was mainly focused on other classes and assignments like my concept art project. I did watch the lecture, which was on responsive design and file organisation, both important subjects, however mostly stuff which I already knew. There was also no coding lecture for this week so even less to learn.</p>

            <h4>Week Ten</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>I spent a lot of this week working on project 2.2. In particular, I had to spend a lot of time figuring out Editor X. I watched a few tutorials which made it look pretty easy, however I found a lot to dislike about the app. For some reason, after a certain point, it kept trying to redirect me to Wix, its sister program, to the point where I had to use it in an incognito tab to stop it from remembering. I also wish it had a desktop version as the web version was slow to load and at one point seemed to have forgotten my files entirely (I got them back eventually). 
                The lecture this week was mainly going over the assignment again and reminding us to work on this blog (which I have been keeping relatively up to date with). 
                The coding lecture was actually a tutorial on EditorX. Annoyingly I realised this after I had already gone through the process of learning it, so it was of less use to me than it would have been.

            <h4>Week Eleven</
                <hr>h4>
            <p>I handed in assignment 2.2 this week. It ended up being fairly straightforward after I somewhat mastered EditorX, though there were still a few hiccups. I was able to make my design almost identical to the one I created in Figma, while also factoring in the feedback I got on that project to make some improvements. Week Eleven’s lecture was mainly about presentations so there wasn’t much learning. However there were some cool blog examples which got me thinking about how I might design my blog for assignment 3. 
                The coding lecture was just going over a design the lecturer did for their assignment, which was fairly straightforward. Overall, the coding lectures have given me a bit more confidence in my abilities going into the final assignment, however there is nothing better for learning to code than hands-on practice.

            <h4>Week Twelve</
                <hr>h4>
            <p>The final week, and a lot to work on. Although I’ve only just started working on project 3, I’ve been finding it quite fun to get back into coding and to solve problems myself. Unfortunately, other assignments have meant that I can’t get a lot of stuff done this week and will have to leave it closer to the due date. Once I’m done with this assignment I’m done with uni for the year which I’m quite excited about. The lecture this week has just been about recapping the class as a whole and discussing the final assignment. Overall this course has been pretty alright for me, sitting somewhere in the middle in terms of worst to best courses. In a way, I would have liked to have gone over some more complex stuff, but I know that there are other courses that will cover that and that it is important to have the basic groundwork covered.</p>
